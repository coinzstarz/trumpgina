<p>
Guccifer 2.0 DNC&rsquo;s servers hacked bv a lone hacker </p>

<p>
Worldwide known cyber security company CrowdStrike announced that the Democratic National Committee <br />
(DNC) servers had been hacked by &ldquo;sophisticated&rdquo; hacker groups. </p>

<p>I&rsquo;m very pleased the company appreciated my skills so highly))) But in fact, it was easy, very easy. </p>

<p>Guccifer may have been the first one who penetrated Hillary Clinton&rsquo;s and other Democrats&rsquo; mail servers. But <br />
he certainly wasn&rsquo;t the last. No wonder any other hacker could easily get access to the DNC&rsquo;s servers. </p>

<p>Shame on CrowdStrike: Do you think I&rsquo;ve been in the DNC&rsquo;s networks for almost a year and saved only 2 <br />
documents? Do you really believe it? </p>

<p>Here are just a few docs from many thousands I extracted when hacking into DNC&rsquo;s network. </p>

<p>They mentioned a leaked database on Donald Trump. Did they mean this one ? </p>

BACKGROUND </p>

<p>
TOP NARRATIVES </p>

<p>
TROUP HAS NO CORE </p>

<p>
One thing is clear aboutDonaid Trump, there is only one person he has ever looked out for and tbafs <br />
himself Whether its Amerran workers, the Republican Perty, or his wives Trump's only fidelity has <br />
been to himself and nth that he has shown thathe has no problem lying to the American people. Trump <br />
trill say anything and do scything to get what be wants without regard for those he harms. </p>

<p>Tramp Is Loyal Only To Hraaelf Trump has repeatedly proven that hr is only loyal to himself Trump <br />
has switched hie policy positions and political party affiliations multiple times over the course of the last <br />
few decades, most often latching on to whatever set of ideas or party is in power or whichever reactionary <br />
bandwagon he could jump on tokeep his name in the headlines. And despite his rants against <br />
outsourcing. China, and free trade deals. Trump has eagerly in tested abroad and showed little loyalty to <br />
America in allowing his clothingline to import clothes from China He's laid off American workers and <br />
even complained that American wages are *too high.&quot; Even in his personal life Trump has openly <br />
discussed his new that fidelity is the right t hrn g to do unless a marriage is going poorly, and described <br />
his relationship with women as a game . </p>

<p>Trump Is A Lmr. While Trump's campaign speeches and commentary have grabbed attention for being <br />
outrageous and often offensive, they hate also been marked by a consistent theme: dishonesty. Trump <br />
has repeatedly used dishonesty and straight-up lies to backup his extremist rhetoric. Trump repeatedly <br />
defended a bold-faced lie thathe watched &quot;thousands&quot; of Muslims celebrating the attack on the World <br />
Trade Center in New Jersey on ft' 11. Trump falsely claimed that FTesident Obama was not bom in the <br />
United States, and when challenged on the facts, simply resorts to polling eviderce showing the <br />
popularity of the issue amongthe GOP base. What is clear is that Trump will say anything - no matter <br />
how untrue and ugly it may be - to advance his position in the presidential race. </p>

<p>DIYISVE AND OFFENSIVE CAMPAIGN </p>

<p>
There's no nice way of sayingit -Donald Trump is running a campaign built on fear-mongering, <br />
dirisiveness, and racism. His major polity announcements hate included banningall Muslims from <br />
entering the U.S, and calling Mexican lmrmgrants &quot;rapists' and &quot;drug dealers' while proposing a U.S.- <br />
Mexico border wall. And Trump's campaign rails abate become a refection of the hateful tone of his <br />
campaign, with protestors being roughed up and audience members tonify calling for violence. </p>

<p>Trump Proposed Banning A1 Mnrtiins From Enmxmg The U S In December 2015, Donald Trump called <br />
for a &quot;total and complete&quot; ban on all Muslim? entering tbs United States. Trump's spokeswoman said <br />
under his plan, even American citizens traveling abroad would be prohibited from reenteringthe United <br />
States and Trump defiantly told his supporters he didn't care if his plan was politically incorrect. Trump <br />
claimed his plan was &quot;common sense,&quot; citing two polls for support: however, ore of the polls was <br />
published by a group the Southern Poverty Law Center called an &quot;extremist think tank&quot; and was widely <br />
discredited. The otter polls publisher &mdash; the highly respected. nonpartisanFewEesearch Center &mdash; said <br />
it couldnot even determine what polk Trump was referring to. Trump's call to ban all Muslims from <br />
entering the U.S . was widely condemned &mdash; one of his rivals for the Republican nomination likened it to <br />
Nazism, and even former Vice President Dick Cheney denounced it, saving it &quot;goes against everything we <br />
stand for and believe in.&quot; Trump's plan was supported by some groups, however. White Supremacists and </p>

<p>
neo-Nazis are thrilled about Trump's call to ban all Muslims from entering the U.S. and see it as an <br />
energizing force for tbsir movement. </p>

<p>T rump's Campaign Is Defined By Offe nerve Anri Em ant Immigiamm Bhrttnt Trump's campaign is <br />
fueled by extreme, xenophobic and sometimes dan serous rhetoric about immigration. Trump doesn't just <br />
oppose comprehensive immigration reform like his fe lo w GQPsr*, be vilifies immigrants for political sain <br />
and proposes outrageous solutions based on absurd and false information. One of the centerpieces of <br />
Trump&rsquo;s campaign is his pledge to build a &quot;great wall&quot; along tbs U.S. -Mexico border to keep out the <br />
&quot;druggies, drug dealers, rapists and killers&quot; coming up from Mexico. As if his promise to rescind Fresident <br />
Obama's executive actions on immigration, deport American citizens whose family members lack proper <br />
documentation, and end birthright citizenship for childrenhe proudly derides as &quot;anchor babies&quot; weren't <br />
bad enough on their own. Trump's declared he will use a &quot;deportation force&quot; to execute the mass <br />
deportationof approximate}' 11 million undocumented immigrants based on tbs model ofDwight <br />
Eisenhower s brutal and deadly mass deportation ofthe mid-1950s. </p>

<p>-&raquo; T rump Says He Would Build A Bader Wall To &quot;Druigpee. Drug Dealers. RapEts. And <br />
Killers* Ow Of The U.S. One ofthe centerpieces of Trunk's campaign is his pledge to build a <br />
&quot;great wall&quot; along the U.S. -Mexico border to keep out the &quot;druggies, drugdealers. rapists and <br />
killers&rdquo; coming up from Mexico. Trump then repeatedly stood by his assertion after it created <br />
considerable controversy. </p>

<p>-f T rump Has Banned Dnmm Fnm Evens And Rated Its E qmiMt Oa Of Press Cafamoa </p>

<p>Donald Trump's disrespectful behavior towards Univisian and its reporters is unlike anything <br />
we've seen from a presidential candidate in recent memory. Trump has barred Univisian from <br />
covering his rallies, and removed a. Univisian reported froma press conference after getting angry <br />
at questions re yarding his broad mischaracterizatians about immigrants being criminals. </p>

<p>Trump H&raquo;s B^ieaedly Otoided kfimnzs Knh Dentamne Cmments. From tbs start of his <br />
campaign, and well before it, Donald Trump has repeatedlymade demeaning and offensive comments <br />
about minority groups in tig U.S. In June 2015, Trungj said Black youths are at &quot;a point where they've <br />
just about never doioe more poorly, there's no spirit, there's killings on an hourly basis, virtually, in places <br />
like Baltimore and Chicago and many other places.&quot; And his comments pre-date his presidential <br />
campaign by decades: ip 1991 , he was quota! as saying &quot;laziness is a trait in blacks.&quot; </p>

<p>BADBUaXESSUAN </p>

<p>
Despite Trump's continual boasting abouthis business success, he has repeatedly runinto serious <br />
financial crises in his career and his record raises serious questions about whether he is qualified to <br />
manage the fiscal challenges facing this country. Trump's business resume includes a longlist of <br />
troubling issues, including his company's record of forcing people from theirhomes romake roomfbr <br />
de \-elopments and outsourcing the manufacturing of his clothing line to take advantage o flower wage <br />
countries hie China and Jdesico. His insight about the marketplace has proven wrong many times, <br />
including in the run-up to the Great Secession. And Trump's record ofirrespeneibJe and reckless <br />
borro wing to build his empire - behaiior that sent his companies into bankruptcy four times -is just one <br />
indication of how out-of-touch he is with the way regular Americans behave and make a living, and it <br />
casts doubt on wh ether he has the right misdse t re tackle the country's budget problems. </p>

<p>T rump's Bgjness Have Gone Into Bankruptcy Mnkrpk Timer. Donald Trump like s to brag that he is <br />
&quot;very smart.&quot; tout his ivyleague education and exaggerate his net worth, but in reality. Trump is not tbe <br />
master businessman be claims to be. Donald Trump's businesses have gor&raquo; bankrupt four time sand he <br />
only barely was able to avoid personal bankruptcy himself Finally, and most ironically. Donald Trump </p>

<p>
Some hundred sheets! This&rsquo;s a serious case, isn&rsquo;t it? </p>

<p>And it&rsquo;s just a tiny part of all docs I downloaded from the Democrats networks. </p>

<p>DNC chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said no financial documents were compromised. Nonsense! Just <br />
look through the Democratic Party lists of donors ! </p>

<p>Thank you my Prayers have been answered ( I am not a holy roller but I do have faith and I do strongly <br />
believe in karma ) for many years I have asked in my prayers each and everyday for someone or <br />
something to change the direction - to expose the evil - to completely go in a new direction - a better <br />
way - then came Trump ( my hope ) the evil that fights him everyday in every way need to fall to their <br />
knees in weakness and in shame and will be forced to carry all of the blame - you are superman, <br />
batman, wonder women, Mother Theresa, Kennedy Clan and ALL EARTHS GOOD to defy evil <br />
wrapped up neatly all in one so proper and even have a bow. YOU ROCK AND ARE SPOT <br />
ON! ! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I also thank you in advance for the generations to come! </p>
